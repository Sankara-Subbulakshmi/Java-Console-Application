# Java-Console-Application
This repository contains a collection of Java console-based applications and practice programs. These are primarily focused on strengthening core Java concepts, problem-solving skills, and command-line I/O handling.
## Topics Covered

- Basic Java syntax and structure  
- Control flow: loops and conditionals  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Exception handling
- Constructors
- Simple algorithms and problem-solving
- This repository includes practice programs that demonstrate key OOP principles in Java:

- **Class & Object**: Understanding the blueprint and instance of objects  
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding data using private variables and public getter/setter methods  
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse  
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take many forms via method overloading and overriding  
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem  
- **Interfaces**: Defining contracts that classes can implement, enabling multiple inheritance
## Java Collections Framework

This repository contains practice programs covering the core components of the Java Collections Framework, which provides data structures and algorithms to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects efficiently.

### Core Collection Interfaces

- **List**: Ordered collection that allows duplicates.  
  - Common implementations: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.

- **Set**: Collection that stores **unique elements** (no duplicates).  
  - Common implementations: `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`.

- **Map**: Stores key-value pairs with unique keys.  
  - Common implementations: `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`.
