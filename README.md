# Java-Console-Application
This repository contains a collection of Java console-based applications and practice programs. These are primarily focused on strengthening core Java concepts, problem-solving skills, and command-line I/O handling.
## Topics Covered

- Basic Java syntax and structure  
- Control flow: loops and conditionals  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Exception handling  
- Simple algorithms and problem-solving
- This repository includes practice programs that demonstrate key OOP principles in Java:

- **Class & Object**: Understanding the blueprint and instance of objects  
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding data using private variables and public getter/setter methods  
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse  
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take many forms via method overloading and overriding  
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem  
- **Interfaces**: Defining contracts that classes can implement, enabling multiple inheritance  

These concepts are fundamental to writing clean, reusable, and maintainable Java code, and the examples here will help reinforce your understanding through practical application.
